This is the repository for my Procedural Ship Game, a top-down combat game where you pilot a toy boat against waves of enemy ships within a foggy pool! Interesting features include:

- Volumetric Fog, can be parted by objects which attenuate the fog density
- Procedural Water with Ripples using render textures and a wave shader
- Render texture scrolling to follow the player across a huge map
- State-machine-based AI enemies
- Boid NPC behaviors to create ship formations
- Procedural behavior generation for enemies, depending on assigned tasks and enemy type
- Procedural enemy attributes, including coloring, decoration, and armaments based on enemy types
- UI & Radar Minimap to enhance immersion
